                            <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Baby Towel</h3>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A baby towel is an essential bath time item, and they are suitable for newborns, toddlers, and beyond.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The cot should be strong and have an adjustable base. That way, you will not have to bend too far to lift your baby during the early months. An adjustable base also means that the base can be lowered for the baby's safety, as your little darling will grow and might try to climb out of the cot. Pick a bed with a plastic cover, as teething babies tend to gnaw on everything.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
